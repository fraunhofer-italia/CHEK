Understanding of the process and mapping of steps:
The comprehension and mapping of the process vary across different stages of maturity. At LEVEL 0, there's a lack of clear understanding, and the process remains informally unmapped. LEVEL 1 signifies a general mapping of the process available to the public. LEVEL 2 indicates detailed documentation identifying process steps and providing initial definition within a digital environment. LEVEL 3 illustrates a detailed mapping integrated into a digital environment for managing technical-administrative processes, although not fully implemented. LEVEL 4 represents a well-coordinated mapping in a central digital environment, where all steps are executed and monitored for constant simplification. At LEVEL 5, the entire process is mapped and orchestrated in a central digital environment, emphasizing automation across steps to heighten efficiency, perpetual monitoring for feedback, and lessons learned.

Stakeholders are aware of process steps and required information they must provide:
Stakeholders' awareness of process steps and required information evolves through various levels. At LEVEL 0, there's a limited understanding and no formal process mapping. LEVEL 1 involves stakeholders with a basic grasp of process steps but with minimal guidance on their roles and responsibilities. LEVEL 2 denotes clear stakeholder understanding facilitated by guidelines and standards. LEVEL 3 signifies comprehensive process documentation and checklists enabling stakeholders to self-serve, supported by online resources and a digital solution that reduces ambiguity. LEVEL 4 represents stakeholders fully aware of process steps, required information, and documentation, but working within their individual digital environments. LEVEL 5 illustrates stakeholders' complete awareness of their roles in the process, with simultaneous communication and support, enabling access to the same data source for various stakeholders.

Benchmarks and key performance indicators:
Levels of quality control and performance monitoring progress as follows: At LEVEL 0, there are no formal quality control plans or performance benchmarks. LEVEL 1 introduces initially defined standards, targets, and benchmarks but lacks official measurement. LEVEL 2 establishes defined standards, quality plans, and clear benchmarks but without official measurement. LEVEL 3 involves proactive quality monitoring through spot checks and structured reviews, with some KPIs measured but not fully implemented. LEVEL 4 measures and monitors performance against benchmarks and KPIs, incorporating them into quality and performance improvement systems. LEVEL 5 showcases continuous alignment and refinement of quality improvements and adherence to regulations, regularly revisiting benchmarks and KPIs for optimal process and service quality.

Standardised process:
The level of standardisation and guidelines for processes unfolds as follows: At LEVEL 0, there are no established guidelines or standards for the process. LEVEL 1 involves mapping the process primarily from an administrative standpoint, with ad-hoc support from internal guidelines aiding technicians in following process steps. LEVEL 2 signifies technicians receiving support from a detailed guideline outlining specific checks at each process step with comprehensive instructions. LEVEL 3 illustrates a comprehensive list guiding technicians through urban planning and construction aspects at each phase of the building permit process. LEVEL 4 highlights continuous refinement and alignment of guidelines with quality improvements and regulations, updating them based on KPIs and benchmarks. Finally, at LEVEL 5, there's a detailed, standardised procedure at the municipality level for all stakeholders, continuously monitored and updated.

Data templates, use of common data formats, and documentation requirements:
The evolution of data standardisation and documentation requirements progresses through various stages. At LEVEL 0, there's a lack of templates, common data formats, or documentation requirements. LEVEL 1 signifies limited standardisation with inconsistencies across permit processes or projects. LEVEL 2 introduces some standardisation efforts in data formats, templates, and documentation, though the achievement of a single standard is ongoing. LEVEL 3 represents internal standardisation but lacks external stakeholder compliance and formal quality control. LEVEL 4 showcases easily accessible standardised formats and templates for all stakeholders, maintaining consistency across the process, while best practices are identified and shared. LEVEL 5 highlights standardised formats following open data standards, continuously improving open format use, and implementing automated controls during the process.

Timelines and response time:
Timelines and response times demonstrate varying levels of definition and adherence. At LEVEL 0, there's no clear knowledge or predefined timelines. LEVEL 1 involves an informal understanding but lacks clear communication and adherence. LEVEL 2 defines timelines internally but faces communication challenges with stakeholders. LEVEL 3 showcases clear and communicated timelines, followed in over 80% of processes, albeit without official measurement or optimization efforts. LEVEL 4 illustrates clearly defined and monitored timelines accessible to stakeholders, allowing for measurement and optimization. LEVEL 5 involves continuous monitoring, measurement, review, and improvement of timelines based on performance metrics and feedback across all process steps.

Accessibility of stakeholders:
Accessibility of information to stakeholders progresses through different stages. At LEVEL 0, information might be accessible through physical documents. LEVEL 1 indicates limited accessibility with differing information sources and workflows for each stakeholder. LEVEL 2 allows stakeholders access to the same data source but requires reloading data changes by other participants. LEVEL 3 involves automated workflows pushing permit status alerts to some stakeholders. LEVEL 4 showcases a unique data source shared among stakeholders within a digital ecosystem, facilitating data sharing and updates. LEVEL 5 represents a comprehensive digital ecosystem with real-time updates, interactive interfaces, personalized notifications, and collaborative features for efficient information retrieval by all stakeholders from the same data source.

Transparency:
Transparency in information workflow shows different levels of accessibility and visibility. At LEVEL 0, there's no transparency with stakeholders unable to access or visualize information other than the final outcome. LEVEL 1 indicates limited access and understanding of the information flow, fragmented documentation, and communication processes. LEVEL 2 allows stakeholders access to information influencing their workflow but lacks clear communication or documentation. LEVEL 3 involves real-time permit tracking with notifications to stakeholders and regular performance monitoring, improving transparency. LEVEL 4 showcases information visibility with defined permissions, a clear workflow, and occasional basic process metrics reported. LEVEL 5 represents an advanced stage with automated workflow tracking, enhanced data analytics, collaborative workflows, and reporting tools to monitor performances and continuously improve process transparency.
