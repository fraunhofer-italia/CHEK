Data quality control:
This area outlines the evolution of data quality control practices, progressing through various levels of maturity. At LEVEL 0, there's a lack of quality control of data, reflecting an absence of structured quality control measures. LEVEL 1 involves informal quality control plans, setting the groundwork for quality control. LEVEL 2 signifies the establishment of quality targets and performance benchmarks to maintain high standards. LEVEL 3 denotes proactive processes for monitoring guidelines through audits and spot checks, utilizing metrics to track quality trends. LEVEL 4 represents comprehensive quality plans ensuring accuracy and consistency, tightly integrated with data validation workflows and automated reporting on adherence and anomalies. Finally, at LEVEL 5, quality improvement and adherence to data standards are consistently prioritized and refined, incorporating an automated feedback loop from lessons learned, signifying a highly refined quality control framework.

Building/intervention design data:
This maturity area outlines the evolution of building/intervention design data, progressing through different levels of sophistication. At LEVEL 0, the data is analog, limited to the use of 2D drawings. LEVEL 1 involves the utilization of 2D drawings with basic semantic data information. Advancing to LEVEL 2, there's a building model with geometric and semantic data, akin to Building Information Modeling (BIM). LEVEL 3 signifies building data with standardized data, aligning with standard formats. LEVEL 4 denotes building data compliant with open standard formats like IFC and specific standard-based data requirements such as MVD, IDS, including metadata. Finally, at LEVEL 5, there's an integrated dynamic building model, incorporating virtually all authoritative information loaded with metadata and fully integrated into data ecosystems, signifying a highly sophisticated data integration approach.

City context data:
This key maturity area delineates the evolution of city context data, progressing through different levels of sophistication. At LEVEL 0, the data remains analogue, limited to the utilization of only 2D maps. LEVEL 1 involves the establishment of a city model, although not entirely populated with corresponding semantic data, leveraging geospatial data, such as GIS. Advancing to LEVEL 2, there's a 3D city model loaded with more than 80% semantic data; however, standardization is lacking. LEVEL 3 signifies a 3D semantic city model with standardized data, marking an organized approach. LEVEL 4 denotes an open-standard based 3D city model compliant with specific data requirements, loaded with relevant information and metadata, yet not linked to other data systems (e.g., BIM). Finally, at LEVEL 5, there's an integrated dynamic 3D city model, functioning as a digital twin, encompassing virtually all authoritative information loaded with metadata and fully integrated into data ecosystems, representing a highly advanced and interconnected data environment.
